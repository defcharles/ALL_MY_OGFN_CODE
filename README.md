# My OGFN Journey

Back in late 2022 I joined OGFN with no coding knowledge at all. I was just here to play with my friends and mess around.

My first project didn't do good at all but we made it work somehow. I kept making more projects until I met someone named Ploosh who owned Project Meowscles at the time. We became friends and started a project called Astro which many of you probably remember.

During Astro, Ploosh introduced me to Itztiva who at the time was a dev at Eon. We started talking more and became friends but sadly Astro started to die so we went on to make Project Solaris which also failed due to some problems and personal things.

We had many other projects such as Celestia then came Solaris V2 which is our current project with over 6k members.

## A New Chapter

I recently turned 18 and have lost motivation to code so sadly I think my time in OGFN is over.

## Thank You

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has stuck with me this whole time and this was a fun experience. Thank you to my friends who stuck with me through every project, success, and failure. To the community members who believed in us. To everyone who made this experience unforgettable. Thank you guys for everything.

With that being said I will probably be open sourcing all my code goodbye.
